# GamePlan

Marques DeHerrera, Nick Clocksin, and Corbin Cunningham

The GamePlan is a registration designed website used to incorporate the buying and attendance of big Gaming conference.

Corbin used illustrator on the logo, Nick used Jquery for the picture slider at the home page, Marques used Google to find the pictures of the conferences.

We would like you to focus on whatever you feel like looking at when you grade our project.
